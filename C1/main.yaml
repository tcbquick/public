Great question ‚Äî **yes**, you **can absolutely `import_tasks` or `include_tasks` inside `pre_tasks`** in your playbooks!

This is super handy when you want to modularize pre-run checks, validations, or setup actions before your main tasks begin.

---

### ‚úÖ Example: Using `import_tasks` in `pre_tasks`

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook with Imported Pre-Tasks
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Import environment validation tasks
      import_tasks: tasks/precheck_environment.yml

    - name: Import SSH validation tasks
      import_tasks: tasks/precheck_ssh.yml

  roles:
    - webserver
```

---

### ‚úÖ Example: Using `include_tasks` in `pre_tasks` (runtime conditional)

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook with Included Pre-Tasks
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    check_environment: true

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Conditionally include pre-environment checks
      include_tasks: tasks/precheck_environment.yml
      when: check_environment

    - name: Include another pre-task at runtime
      include_tasks: tasks/precheck_network.yml
```

---

### üß™ Why `import_tasks` vs `include_tasks` matters here

| Task Type      | Timing     | Can Use `when` | Example Use                          |
|----------------|------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `import_tasks` | Parse-time | ‚ùå (mostly ignored) | Fixed pre-task sequence (always runs) |
| `include_tasks`| Run-time   | ‚úÖ Yes          | Conditional pre-tasks or loops        |

---

### üìÅ Example Task File: `tasks/precheck_environment.yml`

```yaml
---
- name: Check free disk space
  command: df -h /
  register: disk_usage

- name: Warn if free space is low
  debug:
    msg: "Low disk space warning: {{ disk_usage.stdout_lines }}"
  when: "'/dev/root' in disk_usage.stdout"
```

Let me know if you want this structured for reuse in a role‚Äôs `pre_tasks`, or with handler pre-flight checks too.
