Exactly — you can absolutely use `include_tasks` inside a role. In fact, it’s a great way to keep a role modular and conditional.

Here’s how you’d do it inside a **role**, with your `include_tasks` in the role’s `tasks/main.yml` file.

### 📁 Role Directory Structure (example: `roles/webserver/`)

```bash
roles/
└── webserver/
    ├── tasks/
    │   ├── main.yml
    │   ├── install_nginx.yml
    │   ├── install_apache.yml
    │   └── configure_firewall.yml
    ├── handlers/
    │   └── main.yml
    └── templates/
        └── nginx.conf.j2
```

---

### 📜 `roles/webserver/tasks/main.yml`

```yaml
---
- name: Include NGINX tasks when nginx is selected
  include_tasks: install_nginx.yml
  when: web_server == "nginx"

- name: Include Apache tasks when apache is selected
  include_tasks: install_apache.yml
  when: web_server == "apache"

- name: Optionally configure firewall
  include_tasks: configure_firewall.yml
  when: enable_firewall | default(false)
```

---

### 🧩 In your main playbook

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy Web Server Role
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    web_server: nginx         # Or apache
    enable_firewall: true

  roles:
    - webserver
```

---

### 💡 Bonus Tip

You can even **loop over task includes** in roles using:

```yaml
- name: Include a task file for each item
  include_tasks: "{{ item }}"
  loop:
    - install_nginx.yml
    - configure_firewall.yml
```

This is useful for building step-driven workflows in roles.

Want me to show how this ties into a `meta/main.yml` or how to split into multiple roles for NGINX vs Apache cleanly?
