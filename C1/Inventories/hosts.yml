- name: Label nodes for roles
  docker_node:
    hostname: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
    labels:
      role: dns
      location: core
  when: "'dns_nodes' in group_names"

Your provided Ansible task snippet:

```yaml
- name: Label nodes for roles
  docker_node:
    hostname: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
    labels:
      role: dns
      location: core
  when: "'dns_nodes' in group_names"
```

### Explanation:

This task uses the `docker_node` Ansible module to apply specific labels (`role: dns` and `location: core`) to Docker Swarm nodes identified as members of the Ansible inventory group `dns_nodes`.

### How it works step-by-step:

1. **Task name**: Clearly indicates the taskâ€™s purpose (labeling Docker nodes).

2. **docker_node module**:
   - `hostname`: Dynamically references the hostname of the current target node using `{{ inventory_hostname }}`.
   - `labels`: Specifies labels to assign to the node, useful for deploying Docker Swarm services based on node roles.

3. **Conditional statement**:
   - `when: "'dns_nodes' in group_names"`:  
     Ensures that labels are applied only to nodes belonging to the inventory group `dns_nodes`.

### Sample inventory context for clarity:

Given an inventory file such as:

```ini
[dns_nodes]
rpi5-core-201
rpi5-core-251
```

The task would execute and apply the labels `role=dns` and `location=core` specifically to these nodes.

### Example Result in Docker Swarm:

Running the above task for a node (`rpi5-core-201`) would result in:

```bash
docker node inspect rpi5-core-201 --format '{{ json .Spec.Labels }}' | jq
```

Output would be similar to:

```json
{
  "role": "dns",
  "location": "core"
}
```

### Recommendations for Best Practices:

- Consider adding error handling or a verification task after applying labels.
- If managing multiple roles, define labels dynamically based on group membership or host variables.

### Example Enhanced Version:

```yaml
- name: Label Docker Swarm nodes dynamically based on inventory groups
  docker_node:
    hostname: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
    labels:
      role: "{{ node_role }}"
      location: "{{ node_location }}"
  vars:
    node_role: "{{ 'dns' if 'dns_nodes' in group_names else 'default' }}"
    node_location: "{{ 'core' if 'dns_nodes' in group_names else 'edge' }}"
```

This makes the labeling dynamic and extensible for additional node groups.

Your original snippet is clear, concise, and follows standard Ansible practices effectively for managing Docker Swarm node labels.
